## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Block Lab Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.  Please report unacceptable behavior to [info@getblocklab.com](mailto:info@getblocklab.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are also tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Please describe in detail the enhancement and your use case for it.

### Your First Code Contribution

### Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated.  A maintainer will re-run the status check for you.  If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks

### Local Setup

Block Lab development requires Node.js and follows the WordPress coding standards for PHP and JavaScript. In order to get your development environment setup quickly, simply run the following commands after cloning the plugin from Github:

#### Node

**Install Packages**

```
npm install
```

This command installs required Node packages locally and is required before running build setup.

**Watch Changes**

```
npm run dev
```

While developing, it is a best practice to watch for changes. This command will build assets as modifications are made.

#### Composer

```
composer install
```

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
